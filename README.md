# Webscrapping
Project Statement
This project addresses tourism-related issues by analyzing and predicting flight
prices while considering environmental impact. The goal is to provide an
interactive prototype for travelers to choose flights that balance cost and
ecological responsibility. The work was conducted in four stages: defining the
problem, data scraping, machine learning development, and creating an
interactive Streamlit application.
1. Pre-Project: Use Case Definition
Objective
The use case focuses on helping travelers make informed decisions about
flights by predicting prices and evaluating the carbon emissions for each flight.
This aligns with the tourism domain and incorporates an ecological dimension,
enabling users to choose flights with lower environmental impact.
